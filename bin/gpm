SYNOPSIS

    gpm leverages the power of the go get command and the underlying version
    control systems used by it to set your Go dependencies to desired versions,
    thus allowing easily reproducible builds in your Go projects.

    A Godeps file in the root of your Go application is expected containing
    the import paths of your packages and a specific tag or commit hash
    from its version control system, an example Godeps file looks like this:

    $ cat Godeps
    # This is a comment
    github.com/nu7hatch/gotrail         v0.0.2
    github.com/replicon/fast-archiver   v1.02   #This is another comment!
    github.com/nu7hatch/gotrail         2eb79d1f03ab24bacbc32b15b75769880629a865

    gpm has a companion tool, called [gvp](https://github.com/pote/gvp) which
    provides vendoring functionalities, it alters your GOPATH so every project
    has its own isolated dependency directory, its usage is recommended.

    gpm uses subshells to run commands in parallel for performance reasons. In
    some occasions, e.g. when specified packages depend on each other, this
    might result in an error. To instruct gpm to execute go get commands
    sequentially, you can set environment variable GPM_GET_SERIAL.

USAGE
      $ gpm             # Same as 'gpm get'.
      $ gpm get         # Parses the Godeps file, gets dependencies and sets them
                        # to the appropriate version but does not install them.
      $ gpm install     # Parses the Godeps file, installs dependencies, sets
                        # them to the appropriate version and precompiles/installs them.
      $ gpm version     # Outputs version information
      $ gpm help        # Prints this message
